My observations:
- The iterative fibonacci solution took 0 milliseconds for every
iteration
- The recursive fibonacci solution took about 2^n time for every number
- The iterative linked list took 0.09 ms each time it ran, although the complexity is really 0(n)
- The recursive linked list threw a stack overflow error
